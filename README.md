# RGBD-eye-in-hand-robotics-grasping
This project is a eye-in-hand RGBD-based vision system for UR-5 robotics grasping, including voice recognition, object detection and segmentation and pose estimation.

Third Price of ORBBEC 3-D Sensor Application Design Competition in 2018 International Conference on Optical and Photonic Engineering ([ICOPEN 2018](http://jsem.jp/jsem-bbs/img/375.pdf)).

## Run
The three subfolders are the key steps of the project, and see the README for details in [voice recognition](https://github.com/HanjiangHu/ROS-voice-module), [object detection and segmentation](https://github.com/HanjiangHu/ROS-detection-and-segmentation) and [pose estimation](https://github.com/HanjiangHu/ROS-pose-estimation-module).
